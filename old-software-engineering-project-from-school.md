## Project for software engineering class for school (Summer Semester 2018)

https://github.com/jchan13/SWE-squad-project

The project is incomplete. Our assignment was to create a website using an SQL database, and implement that database on the website. We had the idea of creating a class scheduling system for students to register for classes. We came up with the idea from our own system for registering for classes. It is inconvenient when you have to look for the "Class ID" and insert the Class ID from the catalog to register for a class; it is a lot of work. We tried to find a way to ease the process of the class scheduling system by using menus, and by also using other sections of the website, in order for the process of registering for classes to be less confusing. I think the final project result was about 2,000 lines of code.
