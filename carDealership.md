#### Revature Project 1

Set up a car Dealership program in Java that allowed the user to purchase a car, and then when the car was purchased, the car would be removed from the car dealership database and placed in the customerâ€™s database. Used Java, DBeaver, PostgreSQL, and Amazon AWS to host the database to the cloud.
